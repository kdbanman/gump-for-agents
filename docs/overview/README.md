# The overview page ("The Gump Map")

A visual, text-light summary of the directions and findings, made for the owner on 2026-11-14 while research was
paused. Published as a private artifact (the link is in `LEAD.md`); `index.html` here is what was published.

    python3 docs/overview/collect.py     # data/sources/*.json  ->  data/data.json
    python3 docs/overview/build.py       # src/ + data/data.json + gump-core.js  ->  index.html
    node docs/overview/check-core.js     # the page's stepper against reference/golden (sides 8, 9, 11)

- `gump-core.js` is the small JavaScript stepper behind the live run at the top and the ticking clocks. It is
  bit-exact against the three even-sized golden logs; `check-core.js` is the check.
- `data/sources/` holds what five helper agents gathered from the repository that day: `measurements.json`,
  `structure.json`, `project.json`, `swarm.json` (numbers copied out of the repository, each with a `src`), and
  `series.json` (short real runs of the engine made for the figures, each with a `how`). `scripts/` holds the
  scripts behind `series.json`, the fauna verification and `side11.json`; their `how` lines name a scratch
  directory that no longer exists, so point them at a directory of your own.
- The page is a view, not a source. Where it and `research/CLAIMS.md` or the notebook disagree, they are right.
  The swarm section reports what the swarm's files say; none of it has been audited.
- To refresh it after new results: update or regenerate the files in `data/sources/`, run the two commands, and
  republish `index.html` to the same artifact.
